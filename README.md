# NAGPRA Provenance Recording

## Overview

In this proposal we provide an introduction to the NAGPRA Provenance Recording domain. We cover the essential aspects of NAGPRA (Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act), how provenance recording can be used to document the origin and history of cultural items that fall under the purview of NAGPRA, and how leveraging a decentralized network in the recording of this provenance data can disrupt and enhance existing practices in the interests of the key stakeholders, not least the Native American communities for whom NAGPRA holds the greatest significance. By using BTP's Chronicle platform, we aim to implement the [W3C PROV Ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) framework for provenance information interchange in the recording of information related to the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of these cultural items, aiming to facilitate compliance with NAGPRA regulations and support the repatriation process. Here, blockchain technology has a disruptive potential to transform the implementation of NAGPRA in myriad positive ways by introducing decentralization and transparency, enhanced data integrity, inclusive participation, secure data access and ownership, and immutable record preservation.

## NAGPRA: Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act

### Introduction

The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) is a United States federal law that was enacted in 1990. Its primary purpose is to protect the rights and cultural heritage of Native American tribes, Alaska Native communities, and Native Hawaiian organizations. NAGPRA establishes a legal framework for the repatriation of Native American cultural items, including human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony.

### Objectives of NAGPRA

NAGPRA aims to achieve several key objectives:

1. Repatriation: Facilitate the return of Native American cultural items to the affiliated tribes, communities, and organizations to whom they belong.
2. Protection: Safeguard Native American graves, burial sites, and cultural resources from unauthorized excavation, removal, or disturbance.
3. Consultation: Foster collaboration and consultation between federal agencies, museums, institutions, and Native American tribes or organizations regarding the identification, documentation, and repatriation of cultural items.
4. Documentation: Establish comprehensive records and inventories of Native American cultural items held by museums, institutions, and federal agencies, ensuring transparency and accessibility of information.
5. Education and Outreach: Promote public awareness and understanding of the significance and value of Native American cultural heritage.

### Cultural Items Covered by NAGPRA

NAGPRA applies to specific categories of cultural items:

1. Human Remains: The law protects the rights of Native American tribes to claim and repatriate human remains that are in the possession of museums, federal agencies, or other institutions.
2. Funerary Objects: NAGPRA includes objects that were buried with or dedicated to the deceased as part of a Native American burial ceremony or practice.
3. Sacred Objects: These are objects that are considered sacred by a Native American tribe or community and are used exclusively for religious or ceremonial purposes.
4. Objects of Cultural Patrimony: These are cultural objects that have ongoing historical, traditional, or cultural importance to a Native American tribe or community. Such objects include audio and visual recordings.

### Compliance with NAGPRA

Museums, federal agencies, and institutions that receive federal funding are required to comply with NAGPRA regulations. Compliance includes:

1. Inventory and Documentation: Institutions must compile and maintain detailed inventories and documentation of cultural items in their possession or control.
2. Consultation: They are required to consult with affiliated tribes or organizations regarding the identification, documentation, and repatriation of cultural items.
3. Repatriation: When a request for repatriation is made by an affiliated tribe or organization, institutions must initiate the repatriation process in a timely manner.

## Provenance Recording in the NAGPRA Context

### Purpose of Provenance Recording

Provenance recording within the NAGPRA context involves documenting the origin, history, and chain of custody of cultural items. The goal is to create a comprehensive record that tracks the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of these items. Provenance records serve several important purposes:

1. Compliance: Provenance records help institutions comply with NAGPRA regulations by providing a transparent and auditable trail of information for each cultural item.
2. Repatriation Support: Accurate and detailed provenance records assist in the repatriation process by providing evidence of cultural affiliation and aiding in the identification and rightful return of cultural items to their respective tribes or organizations.
3. Research and Documentation: Provenance records contribute to research, scholarly studies, and cultural documentation by providing valuable historical and contextual information about cultural items and their significance.

### Information Captured in Provenance Records

Provenance records for NAGPRA-related cultural items typically include the following information:

1. Acquisition Details: Information about how and when the cultural item was acquired, including the source, donor, purchase, excavation, or other means of acquisition.
2. Ownership History: Documentation of the item's ownership history, including any transfers, loans, or changes in custody over time.
3. Descriptive Details: Detailed descriptions, photographs, or other visual representations of the cultural item to aid in identification and authentication.
4. Cultural Affiliation: Information about the cultural affiliation or tribal affiliation associated with the item, establishing its connection to a particular Native American tribe or organization.
5. Tribal Consultation: Records of consultations with affiliated tribes or organizations regarding the cultural item, including communications, agreements, and repatriation requests.

### Challenges and Considerations

Provenance recording in the NAGPRA domain comes with its own set of challenges and considerations:

1. Incomplete or Fragmented Information: Historical records or documentation may be incomplete or fragmented, making it challenging to establish a complete provenance history for some cultural items.
2. Sensitivity and Cultural Protocols: Recording and handling cultural items require sensitivity and adherence to tribal protocols and cultural practices to ensure respectful and appropriate treatment.
3. Collaboration and Consultation: Effective collaboration and consultation with affiliated tribes or organizations are essential to gather accurate information and ensure the cultural perspective is appropriately represented.
4. Data Security and Privacy: Provenance records contain sensitive and confidential information, necessitating robust data security measures to protect the privacy and integrity of the data.

## Disruptive Potential of Recording NAGPRA-Related Provenance Data on a Permissioned Open Source Blockchain

The implementation of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) has been instrumental in addressing the repatriation and preservation of Native American cultural artifacts. However, despite its significance, the current implementation of NAGPRA faces certain challenges, particularly regarding the centralized control and accessibility of provenance data. To overcome these limitations, our project proposes a disruptive approach by leveraging a permissioned open source blockchain, specifically Hyperledger Sawtooth, to record NAGPRA-related provenance data. By doing so, we aim to empower stakeholders, not least tribes themselves, and create a more transparent and decentralized system for managing, updating, and accessing provenance records. 

### Centralization and Access Control Challenges

One of the critical issues with the current implementation of NAGPRA is the centralization of power and control over provenance data within the recording institutions. This concentration of authority can lead to concerns related to data integrity, transparency, and access. Institutions holding the provenance data have the ability to dictate access privileges, potentially limiting the involvement and contribution of relevant stakeholders, including tribes, in the management and update processes. Moreover, the lack of transparency in the data recording and management can raise doubts about the accuracy and trustworthiness of the provenance information.

### Disruption through Permissioned Open Source Blockchain

To address these challenges, our project proposes the adoption of a permissioned open source blockchain, specifically Hyperledger Sawtooth, to record NAGPRA-related provenance data. This blockchain-based solution introduces a disruptive paradigm where participants, including tribes and recording institutions, can become members of the permissioned network. This shift in the technological infrastructure offers several key advantages:

1. Decentralization and Transparency: The use of a permissioned blockchain enables the distribution of provenance data across multiple nodes within the network. This decentralized architecture ensures that no single entity has exclusive control over the data. All network participants have access to a synchronized and immutable ledger of provenance records, enhancing transparency and fostering trust among stakeholders.

2. Enhanced Data Integrity: By leveraging blockchain's inherent immutability and cryptographic properties, the provenance data recorded on the blockchain becomes tamper-evident and resistant to unauthorized modifications. This strengthens the integrity of the records and provides an auditable trail of the artifact's history, which can be crucial for ensuring compliance with NAGPRA regulations.

3. Inclusive Participation: The permissioned nature of the blockchain network allows for the inclusion of relevant stakeholders, including tribes, in the decision-making and data management processes. With this solution, tribes can actively participate in recording and updating provenance data, ensuring their voices are heard and their knowledge is preserved. It establishes a more inclusive and collaborative approach to the management of Native American cultural artifacts.

4. Secure Data Access and Ownership: Through the implementation of cryptographic mechanisms and smart contract functionalities, the blockchain network can enforce fine-grained access control over the provenance data. This ensures that only authorized parties can access and update specific records, safeguarding sensitive information while promoting data ownership and control among the participating entities.

5. Immutable Record Preservation: Storing provenance data on a blockchain ensures its long-term preservation and immutability. Historical records are securely stored and remain accessible over time, providing a valuable resource for future community initiatives, research, academic studies, and ongoing repatriation efforts.

By leveraging a permissioned open source blockchain, our project aims to disrupt the current paradigm of centralized control and limited accessibility of NAGPRA-related provenance data. We envision a future where tribes, recording institutions, and other relevant stakeholders collaborate on a decentralized platform, fostering transparency, inclusivity, and trust. This disruptive approach has the potential to revolutionize the management and preservation of Native American cultural artifacts, ultimately strengthening the spirit and objectives of the NAGPRA legislation.
